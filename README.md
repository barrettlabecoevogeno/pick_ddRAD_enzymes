# Picking Restriction enzyme for ddRAD

The repository contains some R scripts I wrote to estimate the number of fragments generated by various enzyme/size selection combinations for ddRAD sequencing. I originally wrote it in February of 2016, and it hasn't been updated much since (though it still works, as far as I know).

More description, and a guide of how to use these scripts, can be found in the `ddRAD_enzyme_optimization` file.
